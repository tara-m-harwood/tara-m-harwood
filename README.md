Full-stack software developer and data scientist with extensive experience directing data & technology programs for progressive activist groups.

I find it incredibly satisfying to distill mountains of raw data into golden nuggets of insight, and then produce dashboards and visualizations so that decision-makers can efficiently turn those insights into informed action.  

I also have an interest in AI chatbots, especially ones that have jobs outside customer service!

My technical skills include Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, Postgres, MySQL, Redshift, MongoDB, Python, Pandas, Django, HTML, CSS, and AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language).

Let's have a nice chat!
